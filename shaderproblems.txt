Can't use shader 330\
Maybe 1/it's writing wrong somewhere 2/my Jogl jar can't support the 330 version,
Find the newest Jogl jar - not work - OpenGl have different version too
How to update the openGl version - can't
Check the openGL version in IDEA is 2.1
Check the openGL by OPGL viewer is 4.1
Figure out the reasons?
